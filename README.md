## Highly configurable, Vanilla-friendly Bow variants for 1.12.2

Have you ever complained about how there are thousands of mods that add extra melee weapons and sword variants, but very few that add bow variants that actually fit into Minecraft?

Well, look no further than Mystic Bows!

### By Modpack Devs, for Modpack Devs
Every bow can be highly customized in-game -- including:
- Durability
- Accuracy
- Velocity
- Arrow damage
- Igniting time for Flame enchantments
- **And** **more**! See individual bow descriptions below.

These bows do not have any built-in recipes. Instead, we suggest something like CraftTweaker to add recipes yourself!

# Meet the Bows

# ![crude_bow](https://github.com/Desoroxxx/Mystic-Bows/assets/107653759/6c743458-3f9f-4c7b-aa71-5af1829520bf) Crude Bow
This crudely-crafted bow has poor accuracy, durability, and damage.

# ![bow](https://github.com/Desoroxxx/Mystic-Bows/assets/107653759/2033b082-68f9-49fe-ab07-db92d13e4a79)  Bow
This is a 1:1 copy of the vanilla bow, in case you wish to effectively replace the vanilla bow, or utilize this as a separate bow! You can always use something like Resource Loader to re-texture and re-name this bow for your purposes, to have as a bonus configurable bow.

# ![quick_bow](https://github.com/Desoroxxx/Mystic-Bows/assets/107653759/512ccdce-315c-42c1-a7c1-f12589a75fb1) Quick Bow
Has a very short draw time, at the slight cost of accuracy and velocity.

# ![heavy_bow](https://github.com/Desoroxxx/Mystic-Bows/assets/107653759/a77372cf-1a47-4244-9eeb-91bce44a60f1) Heavy Bow
Has a longer draw time to the benefit of every arrow dealing more damage. Velocity is unchanged.

# ![ranged_bow](https://github.com/Desoroxxx/Mystic-Bows/assets/107653759/a55966ce-b161-49a3-a095-376f64b9d086) Ranged Bow
Zooms in quite a lot, for those long-range snipes! Has a longer draw time to the benefit of increased Arrow Velocity. Draw time and FOV Zoom are bonus configurables.

# ![flame_bow](https://github.com/Desoroxxx/Mystic-Bows/assets/107653759/ed450345-c75c-40da-8e42-7fc86a9febd0) Flame Bow
Ignites all arrows shot as Flame arrows. Ignite time is a bonus configurable. Also casts light when held, when using Optifine Dynamic Lights.

# ![shot_bow](https://github.com/Desoroxxx/Mystic-Bows/assets/107653759/3b853496-2b38-4ecb-9997-e8e6ab70661c) Shot Bow
When fully drawn, splits 1 arrow into many lower-damage arrows, much like a shotgun's spread! Arrow consumption, arrow damage, and number of arrows fired per shot are all bonus configurables.

# ![burst_bow](https://github.com/Desoroxxx/Mystic-Bows/assets/107653759/82db5ec8-fc60-4349-bbd4-57b38a8deb9c) Burst Bow
When fully drawn, fires 1 arrow as two back-to-back arrows, like a burst rifle! Number of arrows per burst, arrow consumption, and delay between arrows are all bonus configurables. Make a machine gun bow, if you want!

# ![feather_bow](https://github.com/Desoroxxx/Mystic-Bows/assets/107653759/811ad7e6-0dfe-49f1-9938-5898f58823ba) Feather Bow
When [Elenai Dodge 2 for 1.12.2](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/elenai-dodge-2/files/all?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A6756) is installed, this bow appears! Instead of using arrows as ammunition, this bow fires arrows that consume the Dodge bar stamina. Think of the Feather Bow converting stamina/magic into arrows, saving you on ammunition! The amount of feathers required/consumed is a bonus configurable.

# ![lightning_bow](https://github.com/Desoroxxx/Mystic-Bows/assets/107653759/b275475b-3763-4ce9-a159-08e76bda1104) Lightning Bow
This deadly bow summons lightning upon arrow-strike. Many bonus configurables, including: number of bolts, radius of bolts, chance of lightning being summoned (out of 100), and if lightning is summoned only upon entity strike (versus hitting anything, including blocks).
